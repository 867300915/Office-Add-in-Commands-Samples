# Simple Add-in Commands Sample #
This sample showcases how to create custom Ribbon buttons on a new Tab (Word). 

## Deploying the Sample


1. Grab the [manifest file](https://github.com/OfficeDev/Office-Add-in-Commands-Samples/blob/master/Simple/Manifest/SimpleAddin.xml) and sideload it per instructions on main [readme](https://github.com/OfficeDev/Office-Add-in-Commands-Samples/blob/master/README.md). Note that the manifest points to an already deployed instance of the sample. If all you want to do is see the sample running, then that is it. 
2. If you also want to deploy the webapp on your own then you can grab the source from the [webapp] (https://github.com/OfficeDev/Office-Add-in-Commands-Samples/tree/master/Simple/Webapp) directory. Use your webserver of choice to host the 3 html files. 
3. Modify the manifest file to make it point to your app instance.
4. If you are using this sample as a template, then modify the manifest to create your own buttons.
