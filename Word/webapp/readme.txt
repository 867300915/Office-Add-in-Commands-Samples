The source code for the web app used in this sample is here: https://github.com/OfficeDev/Office-Add-in-Fabric-UI-Sample 

Note: Remember to use this manifest (https://github.com/OfficeDev/Office-Add-in-Fabric-UI-Sample/Word/manifest/CitationSample.xml) instead to have a button show on the Ribbon. See how easy it is to reuse an add-in that was created prior to add-in commands? :)
