# Excel Add-in Commands Sample #
This sample showcases how to create buttons on an existing Office tab. The sample also showcases communication between Excel and OData source.

## Deploying the Sample


1. Grab the [manifest file ](https://github.com/OfficeDev/Office-Add-in-Commands-Samples/tree/master/Excel/Manifest)and sideload it per instructions on main [readme](https://github.com/OfficeDev/Office-Add-in-Commands-Samples/blob/master/README.md). Note that the manifest points to an already deployed instance of the sample. If all you want to do is see the sample running, then that is it. 
2. If you also want to deploy the webapp on your own, then you can grab the source files and deploy it. If you are going to use Visual Studio please note that while you can use F5 to spin a local webserver **you CANNOT F5 to deploy your manifest**. The only supported method to deploy manifests during the preview are documented on the main [readme](https://github.com/OfficeDev/Office-Add-in-Commands-Samples/blob/master/README.md), you can also look at a more [comprehensive doc in MSDN](https://msdn.microsoft.com/EN-US/library/office/mt607161.aspx).
